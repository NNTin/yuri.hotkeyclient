# Yuri WebAPIClient

## Server Side

First of all, you need to set a request token in the bots `config.json` like in the following example:
```json
{
   "wstoken": "RjmdFcLG62LKXTjDJSgAgYqxX7Nvq7xGJ3LekqtGZD7gDn43GTTa2T7t2uhBF9RG",
}
```
A nice site to generate such tokens is [passwordsgenerator.net](http://passwordsgenerator.net/).

Then, if you host your bot on an private home server *(for example a Raspberry Pi or somethign like that)*, you need to forward the port **`6612`** *(or whatever else port if you had changed it in the websocket.js class)* in your router / gateway.

If everything went successfull, you will see that the websocket is starting right before the Discord client is loggs in:

## Client Side

Just [download](https://github.com/zekroTJA/yuri/releases) the lastest version of the tool and save it somewhere on your PC or compile it by yourself. You'll need Visual Stuido 2015+ for this.

Also, don't forget to place the `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` right next to the file.

Then, just start the tool, log in with the websocket URL *(defaultly something like `http://yourserversIP:6612`)*, your token you've set in the `config.json` and your Discord ClientID *(just enter `<prefix>myid` in the chat and the bot will give you your ID)*. You need to be in a voice channel on any guild the bot is connected to that the bot can fetch the guild and create a player if needed.

Then, just define some key combinations with some sounds.

**Attention:**  
These are global hotkeys! That means, that they *could* overwrite some hot keys of games or programs, so chose them carefully!
